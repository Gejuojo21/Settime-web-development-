    <h1><u>About Myself</u></h1>
    <p><b>My Name is David.Born on August 30<sup>th</sup> 2005. I am an upcoming software programmer. I finished from the institution of settime-Technologies institution.
        I love food and also love softlife, always rugged and ready to learn but the teacher must be jovial not a too 
        serious teacher if not me no go learn anything.My dream is to make the world a better place and let peace reign
        with programming i believe i will make the world a great place. I learnt today on how to usee tags to do things.
        Example like the subscript tag, paragraph tag, heading tag, underlining tag, and lastly the tag that is used to 
        make text bold. It was such an awesome and interactive class with the help of the weird look of my partner sandra
        alway making the class fun and the teacher too is also a great tutor.</b></p>
